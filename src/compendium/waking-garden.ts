It has been in the ground since before the ground was farmed, and it has spent that time teaching the world to cultivate itself: gardens are not something people do to it, gardens are how it spreads. Its body is a graft of every species that ever woke, and it wears them in turn, one shape at a time, changing with the season or the hour as it pleases. It is not malicious. It has no grievance with anyone; it is doing agriculture at a scale where people are a soil amendment, and it is genuinely curious about what anyone thinks it should do instead. Killing it collapses it into a single warm seed. Ending it is a different problem."
