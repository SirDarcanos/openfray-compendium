The Sporing radius is the other thing worth reading carefully. Every other reredos sheds at 5 feet, and the nave sheds at 30, which looks like the line breaking its own rule. It is not. The Building Itself makes the interior of the structure the nave’s body, so a creature standing anywhere inside it is touching the nave — the radius is larger because the creature is bigger, not because the rule changed. The same reasoning is why Shed reaches 30 feet: it is contact contamination, delivered by a wall the target is already inside."
