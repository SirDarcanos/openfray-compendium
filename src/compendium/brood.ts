    "description": "The latchling is where every one of the brood’s attaching parasites begins — and, in the end, where it returns. A blind, mindless grub the size of a thumb-joint, it fastens to a living creature and feeds, and what it feeds on decides what it becomes. On a strong, quick, or hardy host it gorges on raw vitality and thickens into the swamp-bred cyst-and-fluke line. On a clever one it drinks the magic in the blood and molts toward the chantry louse. On a wise or willful one it eats memory, burrowing inward as a gaol worm and, given years, a palimpsest wyrm. Whatever it grows into, a sated adult eventually creeps off to a place that suits its shape — still swampwater, deep grave-loam, a forgotten reliquary — and lays a fresh clutch of latchlings before it dies. None of this happens in the open: the molting and the laying are slow, secret things. What you meet in a fight is only the feeding.",
